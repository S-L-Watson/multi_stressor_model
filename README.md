This model is used to apply multiple environmental stressors, spatially, in a coastal ecosystem to modify Species Distribution Model density values, by the magnitude of stressor impacts. The stressors used are bottom trawling and sedimentation. Empirical stressor response relationships are used to discount rate (annual linear rate of change), which iteratively reduces taxa density over 4 years within the spatial footprint of the stressor. Useful to inform decisions and support marine spatial management and planning.
